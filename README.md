# Mystery Cows

This is an example program that I'm developing alongside [The Solo Hacker's
Guide To Clojure](https://jacobobryant.com/post/2020/guide-to-clojure/). It's
like the board game Clue, but cow-themed. It's deployed at
[cows.jacobobryant.com](https://cows.jacobobryant.com).

In the interest of completing the guide sooner, I haven't yet spent much time
on QA. So don't be surprised if you find something broken :). PRs are welcome.

`#solo-hackers-guide` on [Clojurians Slack](https://clojurians.slack.com) is a
good place to reach me.
